    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Tom. I live in San Diego and graduated from SDSU in 2018. Prior to that, I served in the Marine Corps for five years as a cyber network operator. During the pandemic, I wanted to stay productive and learn how to set up the front-end as well as the back-end. I struggled learning online. So, I enrolled into this course thinking to myself that nothing beats taking a class on the subject. I would be able to ask questions and have guidance on any materials that didn't make sense to me. I am very excited to be part of the course. Thank you for having me.
    </p>
