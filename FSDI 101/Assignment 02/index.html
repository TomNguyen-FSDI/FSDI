        <p class="paragraph"> &emsp;Hi, I'm Tom and I live in San Diego. I graduated from SDSU in 2018. Prior to that, I
            served in the
            Marine
            Corps for five years as a cyber network operator. During the pandemic, I wanted to stay productive and learn
            how to set up the front-end as well as the back-end. I struggled learning online. So, I enrolled into this
            course thinking to myself that nothing beats taking a class on the subject. I would be able to ask questions
            and have guidance on any materials that didn't make sense to me. I am very excited to be part of the course.
            Thank you for having me.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;I love to watch movies, TV shows, and occasionally read. Currently, I am watching <i>Parks and
                Recreation</i>, on season 3, and enjoying it with my meals. It is similar to the TV show <i>The
                Office</i>. If you do enjoy <i>The Office</i> give <i>Parks and Recreation</i> a try. It is a
            lighthearted humor from the perspective of what it would be like to work in a local government. It shows the
            daily difficulties one would encounter as a government employee. On the left I also include movies and books
            that I am reading and recently watched.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;The book I am currently reading is <i>The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient
                Wisdom</i>. It is about how one can find happiness in their daily life in a world that seems to be
            getting more depressed and stressed
            out. The one thing that I got so far from it, is taking the time each day to meditate can greatly reduce the
            stress in your life. I try to apply that to coding. I call it, mindful coding and it is wonderful. The book
            reminds me that
            one could search for something to be grateful about. For example, I have hands to type and you have eyes to
            read. While there are some unfortunate souls, they may not have that as an option. When I think from that
            perspective and it moves me from a negative state to a positive state.
